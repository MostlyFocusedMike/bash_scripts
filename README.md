# Bash Scripts

### PROJECT GOALS
Just a place to store the bash scripts I write

### PROJECT NOTES 
Here's what each script does: 

new_site: Sets up a new web folder correctly, as well as sets up my preffered Vim window configuration and saves the session.

sass_watch: A quick way to set up sass, works well with new_site.

tester: Not actually a script, it's only for sandboxing...which is probably what I should've called it now that I think about it.
