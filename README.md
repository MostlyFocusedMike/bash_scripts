# Bash Scripts

###PROJECT GOALS
Just a place to store the bash scripts I write

###PROJECT NOTES 
Here's just what each script does: 

new_site: Sets up a new web folder correctly, as well as sets up my preffered Vim window configuration and saves the session

sass_watch: Just a quick way to set up sass, works well with new_site
